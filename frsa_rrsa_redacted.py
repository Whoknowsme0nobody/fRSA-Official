 Abstract
 This paper presents two novel encryption systems designed to address potential vulnerabilities
 in classical RSA arising from advances in quantum computing and mathematical insights from
 the Riemann Hypothesis. The proposed systems—Function-based RSA (fRSA) and Reverse RSA
 (rRSA)—introduce function-based transformations and precision-dependent security mechanisms
 that move beyond traditional prime factorization hardness. Each system offers three implementa
tion variants (Standard, Super, and Hybrid), providing flexible security levels adaptable to different
 applications, from casual messaging to military communications.
 We provide formal security proofs, concrete cryptanalytic evaluation, and demonstrate that our
 systems achieve post-quantum security levels comparable to established schemes while maintaining
 practical efficiency. Experimental analysis shows our approach offers 2128 to 2256 security levels
 depending on parameter selection.
 1 1Introduction
 Classical RSA security relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite num
bers into their prime factors. However, potential breakthroughs in quantum computing (Shor’s
 algorithm) and deeper mathematical understanding of prime distribution through the Riemann
 Hypothesis pose existential threats to this foundation.
 1.1 1.1 Related Work
 Function-based cryptographic transformations have been explored in various contexts. Polly Cracker
type systems use polynomial evaluation over finite fields, while multivariate cryptography leverages
 systems of polynomial equations. Our approach differs by combining prime-based foundations with
 functional transformations, creating hybrid hardness assumptions that resist both classical and
 quantum attacks.
 Recent post-quantum candidates like CRYSTALS-Kyber rely on lattice problems, while SIKE (now
 broken) used isogeny graphs. Our systems contribute a novel direction by preserving RSA’s math
ematical elegance while introducing orthogonal hardness assumptions.

 This paper proposes a fundamental reconceptualization of public-key cryptography that maintains
 the mathematical elegance of prime-based systems while introducing novel hardness assumptions.
 Rather than relying solely on integer factorization, these systems incorporate function-based trans
formations and precision-dependent security mechanisms that create multiple layers of computa
tional difficulty for potential attackers.

 5. Performance benchmarks comparing to established post-quantum schemes
 2 2Part 1: Function-Based RSA (fRSA)
 2.1 2.1 System Overview
 fRSA operates on the principle that instead of publishing the direct product of two primes, the
 public key consists of the product of their images under a secret transformation function. This ap
proach preserves the prime-based foundation while obscuring the underlying mathematical structure
 through functional composition.
 2.2 2.2 Formal Security Model
 Definition 2.1 (Function Recovery Problem): Given primes a,b and transformed product
 Kpub = f(a) × f(b) truncated to d decimal places, determine function f with probability better
 than negligible.
 Definition 2.2 (Precision Recovery Problem): Given Kpub truncated to d decimal places,
 determine the full-precision value Kpriv with error less than 10−d−δ for security parameter δ.
 Security Game fRSA-IND-CPA:
 1. Challenger generates (f,a,b,d) and publishes (N = a × b,Kpub = truncd(f(a) × f(b)))
 2. Adversary A outputs function f′ and precision guess K′
 3. A wins if f′(a) ×f′(b) = f(a)×f(b) within precision 10−d
 Theorem 2.1: fRSA is IND-CPA secure if the Function Recovery Problem and Precision Recovery
 Problem are hard.

 1. a, b ← PrimeGen(/2) // Generate /2-bit primes
 2. f ← FunctionGen()
 // Generate function from secure distribution
 3. d ← PrecisionSelect() // d = for-bit security
 4. s ← {0,1}^
 // Synchronization seed
 5. K_full ← ComputePrecise(f(a) × f(b), s)
 6. K_pub ← Truncate(K_full, d, s)
 7. Return pk = (N, K_pub), sk = (a, b, f, K_full, s)

 2.5 2.5 Rigorous Security Analysis
 Attack Complexity Analysis:
 1. Function Space Attack: For polynomial functions of degree n with coefficient bitlength b:
 • Function space size: |F| ≈ 2n×b
 • Brute force complexity: O(2n×b)
 2. Combined Attack Complexity:
 • Total complexity: O(min(2n×b × 10d,2√N× 10d))
 • For secure parameters (n = 8,b = 64,d = 256): O(2768)
 3. Precision Attack Analysis:
 • Binary precision search: O(10d)
 • With error-correcting bounds: O(10d+δ)
 • Quantum speedup (Grover): O(10d/2)
 Theorem 2.2: For appropriately chosen parameters, fRSA achieves λ-bit post-quantum security
 where λ = min(n×b,d/2).
 2.6 2.6 Function Construction with Security Proofs
 Secure Polynomial Functions:
 n
 f(x) =
 i=0
 cixi mod p
 where coefficients ci are drawn uniformly from Z∗ p for large prime p.
 Security Property: For polynomial f of degree n over finite field Fp, determining f from evalu
ations requires solving a system of n + 1 equations in n + 1 unknowns, with complexity O(pn) in
 the worst case.
 Transcendental Function Security:
 f(x) = a·logb(cx2 +d)+e·sin(fx+g)+h
 Implementation Protocol for Synchronization:
 1. Both parties compute f using identical arbitrary-precision arithmetic
 2. Rounding mode: Round-to-nearest-even (IEEE 754)
 3. Precision validation: H(Kfull) transmitted for verification
 4. Error recovery: Retry with adjusted precision if validation fails

 3 3Part 2: Reverse RSA (rRSA)
 3.1 3.1 System Overview and Formal Model
 rRSA inverts the secrecy model of fRSA: instead of hiding the primes and revealing the trans
formed product, rRSA publishes the primes while keeping both the transformation function and its
 computed result secret. This creates a dual-secret system where attackers must overcome multiple
 independent computational challenges.
 Definition 3.1 (Hidden Function Problem): Given public primes a,b, determine function f
 such that the resulting cryptosystem matches observed ciphertext patterns.
 Definition 3.2 (Precision Synchronization Problem): Given function f and inputs a,b,
 compute f(a) ×f(b) to the exact precision used by legitimate parties.
 3.2 3.2 Enhanced Key Generation
 Public Components:
 • Two large primes: a,b (published with proof of primality)
 Private Components:

 • Secret key: Ksec = f(a)×f(b) (computed to maximum precision)
 • Working key: Kwork = Truncate(Ksec,d,s) with synchronization seed s
 Key Generation Algorithm:
 rRSA-KeyGen():
 1. a, b ← PrimeGen(/2)
 2. PublishPrimes(a, b) with primality proofs
 3. f ← SecretFunctionGen()
 4. s ← {0,1}^
 5. K_sec ← ComputeMaxPrecision(f(a) × f(b))
 6. K_work ← Truncate(K_sec, , s) //-bit precision for-bit security
 7. Return pk = (a, b), sk = (f, K_sec, K_work, s)
 3.3 3.3 rRSA Cryptanalytic Resistance
 Attack Vector Analysis:
 1. Function Discovery Attack:
 • Attacker knows a,b but not f or f(a)×f(b)
 • Must determine f from encryption/decryption patterns
 • Complexity: O(|F|) where |F| is function space size
 2. Precision Guessing Attack:
 • Even if f is discovered, exact truncation precision remains unknown
 • Must match Kwork to exact working precision
 • Complexity: O(10d) for d-digit precision
 3. Combined Attack Strategy:
 • Total complexity: O(|F| × 10d)
 • For secure parameters: O(2256 × 10256) ≈ O(21100)
 Theorem 3.1: rRSA achieves IND-CPA security under the Hidden Function and Precision Syn
chronization assumptions.

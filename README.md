# Enhanced Function-Based RSA Systems (fRSA-E & rRSA-E)

## üöÄ Revolutionary Post-Quantum Cryptography

This project implements **Enhanced Function-Based RSA (fRSA-E)** and **Enhanced Reverse RSA (rRSA-E)** - novel cryptographic systems that address vulnerabilities in classical RSA through function-based transformations and precision-dependent security mechanisms.

### üîë Key Innovation: Hybrid Encryption Formula

```
c = (m^k) √ó (m mod N)
```

Where:
- `m` = plaintext message (integer)
- `k` = high-precision real number derived from `f(a) √ó f(b)`
- `N = a √ó b` = public modulus
- `c` = ciphertext (real number)

> **BREAKTHROUGH:** Unlike classical RSA's `c = m^e mod N`, our hybrid formula combines **exponential** and **modular** components with a **real-valued secret exponent**, creating multiple layers of computational hardness.

## üî¨ Technical Architecture

### Enhanced fRSA (fRSA-E)
- **Public Key**: Prime factors `a, b` and modulus `N`
- **Private Key**: Secret function `f` and derived key `k`
- **Security Model**: Function and precision secrecy

### Enhanced rRSA (rRSA-E)  
- **Public Key**: Prime factors `a, b` are public
- **Private Key**: Function `f` and derived key `k` are secret
- **Security Model**: Dual-secret system with orthogonal hardness

### Standardized Precision Protocol (SPP)
```python
def standardized_precision_protocol(a, b, precision_bits=512):
    # Deterministic high-precision computation
    k = secure_function(a) * secure_function(b)
    # Cryptographic normalization
    k_work = H(k) mod 2^precision_bits
    return k_work
```

## üîß Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from frsa_enhanced import fRSA_keygen, fRSA_encrypt_with_private_key

# Generate keys
pub_key, priv_key = fRSA_keygen(security_level=128)

# Encrypt (currently requires private key)
message = 1234
ciphertext = fRSA_encrypt_with_private_key(message, priv_key)

print(f"Message: {message}")
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")
print(f"Formula: c = (m^k) √ó (m mod N)")
```

### Security Function
```python
def secure_function(x):
    """
    f(x) = e^(cos(x)) * sin(x^2 + 1) + x * ln(x + 1)
    - No undefined domains
    - Nonlinear coupling between terms
    - No single dominant term
    """
    return math.exp(math.cos(x)) * math.sin(x**2 + 1) + x * math.log(x + 1)
```

## üèÜ Challenge

**Think you can break it?**

The Enhanced fRSA systems present multiple computational challenges:
1. **Discover the secret function** `f(x)` from ciphertext patterns
2. **Reproduce the exact precision** of key derivation
3. **Solve the hybrid equation** `c = (m^k) √ó (m mod N)` for unknown `m`

Even with quantum computers, these combined challenges create exponential complexity barriers.
